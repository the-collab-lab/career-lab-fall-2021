# Sync: Pair interview practice

## Let's pair up and practice interviewing with fellow Collabies!

Each Collabie participating in Career Lab has been paired up with a partner below to practice interviewing.

Reach out to your partner, schedule a meeting between June 9th-10th, and work through the questions listed in the pages below so that you can each feel more confident navigating the technical and job-fit interviews!

[Job fit interview questions](../resources/job-fit-interview-questions.md)

[Technical interview questions](../resources/technical-interview-questions.md)

Once you've met and practiced, check the box above next to your name to mark that you've completed the task! âœ…

If you have questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out in your cohort Slack channel!
