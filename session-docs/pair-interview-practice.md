# Sync: Pair interview practice

## Let's pair up and practice interviewing with fellow Collabies!

While this session is optional, each Collabie participating in Career Lab is encouraged to pair up with a partner to practice interviewing.

Reach out to a fellow Collabie, schedule a meeting, and work through the questions listed in the pages below so that you can each feel more confident navigating the technical and job-fit interviews!

[Job fit interview questions](../resources/job-fit-interview-questions.md)

[Technical interview questions](../resources/technical-interview-questions.md)

If you have questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out in your cohort Slack channel!
