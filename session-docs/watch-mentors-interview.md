# Sync: Watch our mentors interview each other ðŸ˜…

We thought it would be helpful for you to see how a professional web developer answers questions in an interview format, so weâ€™re going to role play 2 interviews live for the group. This wonâ€™t be stressful at all! ðŸ˜…

There are 2 common types of interviews that most companies do: job fit and technical. **Job fit interviews** typically attempt to assess whether the person has the general background, skills, and attitude to be successful in the open role. **Technical interviews** are geared towards determining the technical skill level of the applicant.

# Job fit

Andrew will interview Alejandro.

# Technical

John will interview Indira, spending most of the time reviewing her take home assignment.
