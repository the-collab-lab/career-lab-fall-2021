# How to setup a Career Lab cohort

- [ ] Reach out to specific mentors to see about running all the Sync sessions listed on the README
- [ ] Create calendar events for each session
    - [ ] Add Zoom links to each calendar event and make sure there is a host
- [ ] Create Zap that when a Collabie reactji's confirming participation, it adds them to all the calendar events 
- [ ] Add all participating mentors to sessions as optional
- [ ] Run pairing scripts for Collabie/Mentor pairings and manually pair Collabies based on timezone for interview practice
